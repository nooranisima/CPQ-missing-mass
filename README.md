**"Conformal Prediction Beyond the Seen: A Missing Mass Perspective for Uncertainty Quantification in Generative Models"**  
*by Sima Noorani, Shayan Kiyani, George Pappas, and Hamed Hassani*

ðŸ“„ The paper introduces a principled framework for uncertainty quantification based on the concept of **missing mass**. By modeling the probability of failing to observe the true label through a query oracle, we derive two algorithmic principles that guide both query allocation under a budget and prediction set construction. Our resulting algorithm achieves significantly more informative prediction sets while preserving distribution-free coverage guarantees in settings with black-box access to models like large language models (LLMs).
